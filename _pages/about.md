· I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in [Meredith Ecosystem Genomics Lab](https://www.laurameredith.com/) from University of Arizona and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory since 2023.

· Prior to joining UArizona, I was 2023. I received my Ph.D. at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2023, supervised by [Prof. Kinglun Yeung](https://www.kinglunyeung.com/) and [Prof. Joseph Kwan](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/people/joseph-kai-cho-kwan/); and my Bachelor degree in Zhejiang University in 2017.


mainly focusing on how trace VOCs, produced by microbial, plant, and abiotic processes, enhance soil carbon storage at the University of Arizona



and contribute to field work in the [Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/), to determine the impact of deep soil warming on soil carbon in the coniferous forest.

I completed my PhD (2023) in , co-supervised by  at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, centering on the allelopathic potential of microbial volatile emissions on suppressing malodor at Victoria Harbor. I received a bachelor degree in agricultural resources and environment from Zhejiang University, studying from [Prof. He-Ping Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhaoheping) where I discovered my interest in microbial remediation on VOCs and pursued further interdisciplinary study.
