I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in [Meredith Ecosystem Genomics Lab](https://www.laurameredith.com/), mainly focusing on how trace VOCs, produced by microbial, plant, and abiotic processes, enhance soil carbon storage at the University of Arizona and contribute to field work in the [Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/), to determine the impact of deep soil warming on soil carbon in the coniferous forest.

I completed my PhD (2023) in [KLY Health and Environmental Innovation Lab](https://www.kinglunyeung.com/), co-supervised by [Prof. Joseph KWAN](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/people/joseph-kai-cho-kwan/) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, centering on the allelopathic potential of microbial volatile emissions on suppressing malodor at Victoria Harbor. I received a bachelor degree in agricultural resources and environment from Zhejiang University, studying from [Prof. He-Ping Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhaoheping) where I discovered my interest in microbial remediation on VOCs and pursued further interdisciplinary study.
